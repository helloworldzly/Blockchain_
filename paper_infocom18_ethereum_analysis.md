### Abstract
In this paper, we conduct the **first systematic study** on Ethereum by leveraging graph analysis to characterize three major activities on Ethereum, namely **money transfer, smart contract creation, and smart contract invocation**. We propose new approaches based on cross-graph analysis to address two security issues in Ethereum, including **attack forensics** and **anomaly detection**.
